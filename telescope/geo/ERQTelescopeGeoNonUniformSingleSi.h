/** @class ERQTelescopeGeoNonUniformSingleSi
 ** @brief Class for the non-uniform single silicon station entity.
 ** @author M.Kozlov <kozlov.m.your@yandex.ru>
 ** @version 1.0
 **
 ** The class defines non-uniform single silicon station as pseudo-intersection
 ** between perpendicular stips between different silicon stations.
 ** It is constructed by inhomogeneity maps retrieved from the calibration procedure
 ** by means of (TODO: link to calibration classes description). 
 ** Strips of the single thin station are divided 
 ** into pixels depending on choosen second station strip plane. For example, if second 
 ** station is doubled then division into pixels may be different for first and second 
 ** double-Si strip planes due to different strips count on theese sides.
 ** 
 ** In this implementation there is no non-sensitive frame around the station.
 ** 
 ** For now, until clarification of the thin detector calibration, three maps are needed:
 ** * full pseudo-pixel map (/TODO: clarify what values are included)
 ** * map of the front dead layer for the single silicone station
 ** * map of the back dead layer for the single silicone station
 **
 ** The information about stations from the DB is needed for further advanced methods
 ** of the geometry creation when beam not parallel and relative position of
 ** stations influences on the spatial trajectories spreading.
